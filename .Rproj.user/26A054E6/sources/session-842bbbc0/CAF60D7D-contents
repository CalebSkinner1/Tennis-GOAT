This website measures the success of professional male tennis players in Grand Slam Tournaments in the Open Era (from 1968 onward).

The scoring system is simple. Players earn points for defeating players and advancing far in one of the four Grand Slam Tournaments each year. Players earn "victory points" corresponding to their opponent's official ranking by defeating them. Players lose victory points for each loss. Victory points are earned on the following scale:

```{r victory points}
#| tbl-cap: Victory Points
tibble("Opponent's Rank" = c("1-100", "100+"),
       "After Win" = c("100 - Opponent's Rank", "1"),
       "After Loss" = c("-Opponent's Rank", "-99")) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  width(j = c(2,3), width = 1.5) %>%
  width(j = c(1), width = 1.2) %>%
  set_caption("Victory Points")
```

Players earn bonus points for advancing far in tournaments.

```{r bonus points}
#| tbl-cap: Bonus Points
tibble("Round" = c("Quarterfinal", "Semifinal", "Final", "Champion"),
       "Points" = c("10", "30", "60", "100")) %>%
  flextable() %>%
  align(align = "center", part = "all") %>%
  width(j = c(2), width = 1.2) %>%
  width(j = c(1), width = 1.4) %>%
  set_caption("Bonus Points")
```
